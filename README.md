# Disney Characters Lister

This project is made for a competition organized by GDSC Pdeu and ENCODE Club

## Getting Started

The skeleton code used in this project is from the workshop organized by encode conducted by Haard shah.
The main aim of the Project is to call an API through the app and appropriately present the received information.

## Features
- The app checks if some information is present and if there is no available information about a particular field then it gives a "No information available message"
- Custom fonts have been added to the app
- Professional color palettes have been used.
- Entries are displayed in a bullet list format
- Factory functions have a few list entries.
- async await functions are used to make resolving promises easier
- Free API services have been used to demonstrate app development capabilities.
- Made responsive to adapt to different platforms
- Some contents have been wrapped so as to prevent the renderblock from overflowing

## Future plans 
- To make personalized cards with images for each character
- To add a search box that searches from the list and displays content for the relevant character
